    <p><h3>Tastiest Cheesecake in the World</h3></p>
    <p>For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. Finally, here we are.</p>
    <p>Oh, and we are skipping the water bath! I’ve always found them to be largely unnecessary with cheesecakes. Cook yours on a low temperature and follow my tips below and you’ll have a perfectly creamy and crack-less cheesecake without all the hassle of a water bath.</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graham Crackers</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C)</li>
        <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted butter and uses a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract, salt, and stir until well-combined.</li>
        <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
